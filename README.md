# So you're looking for a music bot?

### Well, there isn't going to be one in the ModernBots suite for a couple reasons:
- ModernBots is meant to *fill the gap* for bots that don't meet the ModernBots vision
- Music hosting is expensive, way more than any other kind of bot

### That's why we reccomend [Ear Tensifier](https://eartensifier.net/). Why?
- It's made by people that know what they're doing
- It's modern and uses slash commands
- [It's fully free and open source](https://github.com/Tetracyl/eartensifier)
- It has seemingly good hosting & backup bots

So yea.
